# drought-proness-identification
Featured image must be detected. o Feature extraction based on image dataset.  o Store the cropped faces in a folder.  o Train image has classified into drought and non-drought.  o Display the classification of images for featured extracted image.
In this Project, we proposed:
o A novel remote sensing image object detection framework based on 
Multi-scale Image Block level F-CNN model which needs image blocklevel labels only and can reduce the human labors.
o A Multi-scale Image Block-level F-CNN model combining the multi-scale 
structure and image block-level F-CNN model is proposed to detect the 
various types of objects.
o A method to obtain object detection results from a very large scene 
image.
To extract drought objects, a subset image was created in the eastern part of 
Ethiopia. This area was selected because the maximum normalized 
difference vegetation index NDVI deviation value and the highest area 
coverage of the NDVI deviations were observed in this location. Using this 
subset image, the intensity of drought in the area was assessed. For this 
purpose, a total of 146 points were systematically generated in a point grid 
map of the study area. From these selected point data, about 71% of the 
pixels were found to have negative deviation values and about 29 pixels had 
positive NDVI deviations. The assumption here is that the negative NDVI 
deviations are revealing the prevailing drought in the area and the positive 
deviations are showing the healthy vegetation growth in the area. The NDVI
